## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to use Golang to serve server-rendered React components while maintaining client-side interactivity. The application consists of:

- **Client-side React code:** Hydrates the browser using rendered JSX.
- **Server-side rendering:** Generates both HTML and a JSON serialized version of the React component tree using React's `renderToString` and a custom `renderToJSON` function.
- **Helper functions:** Serialize and deserialize React elements so that the state can be transferred between the server and the client.
- **Golang integration:** Uses the Echo framework for efficient HTTP handling, a custom template renderer, and polyfills to simulate a minimal browser environment on the server.

## Project Structure

The codebase is divided into front-end and backend components:

### Frontend

- **`frontend/app/`**  
  Contains entry files for client-side components (e.g., `Home.jsx`, `About.jsx`, `PokemonDetail.tsx`). These files are responsible for hydrating the application by deserializing the RSC JSON payload.

- **`frontend/components/`**  
  Hosts both client and server components. For example, components like `Counter.jsx` and `WelcomeMessage.jsx` work on the client, whereas components flagged as server components (using properties such as `$$typeof`) are rendered on the server.

- **`frontend/lib/`**  
  Provides helper functions related to RSC. The file `rsc.helpers.jsx` implements functions including:

  - `serializeElement(element)`: Converts a React element into a serializable JSON format.
  - `deserializeElement(json)`: Rebuilds a React element from its JSON representation.

- **`frontend/server/`**  
  Contains server-specific entry points for React components (e.g., `Home.jsx`, `About.jsx`, `PokemonDetail.tsx`). These files expose global functions to render components both as HTML and as JSON (for RSC).

### Modules (Golang)

- **`modules/app/`**  
  Sets up routes for different pages (such as `/about` and `/pokemon`).

- **`modules/lib/template/`**  
  Bundles the client and server assets using esbuild and renders dynamic HTML templates using Go's template engine.

- **`modules/lib/pokemon/`** and **`modules/services/`**  
  Provide API integrations with third-party services like the PokeAPI.

### Templates

- **`templates/`**  
  Contains HTML templates where the server-rendered HTML and initial RSC JSON (stored in a global variable) are injected.

## Client-Side Implementation

On the client, React takes over by hydrating the static HTML generated by the server. The steps are:

1. **Retrieve the Serialized React Element:**  
   The initial component state is embedded in the HTML as a JSON string (e.g., via a global variable).

2. **Deserialize the Component Tree:**  
   Use helper functions such as `deserializeElement` to convert the JSON back into React elements.

3. **Hydrate the DOM:**  
   React 18's `hydrateRoot` attaches React's event system to the pre-rendered DOM for interactivity.

Below is an example from `frontend/app/Home.jsx`:

```jsx:frontend/app/Home.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { deserializeElement } from '../lib/rsc.helpers';

const initialElementJSON = window.__INITIAL_CLIENT_JSX_STRING__;
const element = deserializeElement(initialElementJSON);

hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), element);
```

## Server-Side Rendering with React

The server generates two main outputs for each page:

1. **Standard Server Rendering:**  
   Uses React's `renderToString` to produce HTML.

2. **RSC Rendering:**  
   Uses a custom `renderToJSON` function to serialize the React component tree into JSON, which is then used for client-side hydration.

For example, the server-side entry in `frontend/server/About.jsx`:

- Sets up a minimal environment with polyfills (emulating `window`, `document`, etc.).
- Exposes two functions: `Render` for HTML and `RenderRSC` for RSC JSON generation.

---

## RSC Helpers: Serialization & Deserialization

The ability to serialize a React element tree is crucial for React Server Components. The helpers work as follows:

- **`serializeElement(element)`**  
  Walks through the React element tree, converting component types and props (including special cases like Suspense or server components) into a JSON structure.

- **`deserializeElement(json)`**  
  Converts the serialized JSON back into a React component tree by resolving registered components by name.

This mechanism allows the server to send a fully rendered or serialized component tree to the client for rehydration.

---

## Golang Integration

The Golang backend is implemented using the Echo framework:

- **Route Handling:**  
  In `modules/app/app.go`, routes are defined to serve the various pages (e.g., `/about`, `/pokemon`). A dedicated `/rsc` endpoint is also set up for handling React Server Component requests.

- **Template Rendering:**  
  The Go template engine is used to integrate:
  - Server-rendered HTML.
  - The RSC JSON payload (stored in a global variable such as `INITIAL_CLIENT_JSX_STRING`), which is later deserialized by the client.

This design offers efficient performance while providing dynamic content rendering.

---

## Bundling and Polyfill

The template renderer, found in `modules/lib/template/template.go`, uses esbuild to bundle both client-side and server-side assets. Additionally, a polyfill (e.g., in `frontend/server/polyfill.js`) is incorporated to simulate a minimal browser-like environment, including globals like `document`, `window`, and `URLSearchParams` necessary for server-side operations.

---

## Bringing It All Together

The complete flow from server to client involves:

1. **Building Client Assets:**  
   The Go template rendering process triggers esbuild to bundle React components, which are served under `/assets`.

2. **Routing Requests:**  
   The Echo server maps URL routes to specific handlers. For each request, it performs:

   - HTML generation via the `Render` function.
   - JSON serialization of the React component tree via the `RenderRSC` function.

3. **Client Hydration:**  
   The embedded JSON is read by the client-side JavaScript, deserialized, and then hydrated using `hydrateRoot`, ensuring that interactivity is restored.

4. **Interactive Components:**  
   After hydration, components like `Counter` and `ServerSuspense` remain fully interactive, with subsequent data fetching handled through dedicated endpoints.

---

## Conclusion

By combining the following elements, you can build scalable and high-performance web applications that leverage React Server Components with a Golang backend:

- **Client-Side Hydration** using React 18's `hydrateRoot`.
- **Server-Side Rendering** via `renderToString` and a custom `renderToJSON` function.
- A robust mechanism for **serialization and deserialization** of React elements.
- Efficient HTTP handling and templating with Golang's **Echo framework**.

This integration example provides a solid foundation for building modern web applications that deliver fast, interactive user experiences.

Happy coding!
